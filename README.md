# FlightCal

## Overview

This is some work for my 2024 NCEA Level 2 Digitech Class at [Wainuiomata High School](https://wainuiomatahigh.school.nz/).

## Main Project Directory

This is an app that will determine your theoretical discounted flight price using factors such as flight class, empty seat quantity, and type of discount.
It will be posed and framed as a inward-facing application for clerks and other consumer-facing workers.
This will be an internal application and as such, will be designed and have prompts phrased accordingly.
